This project is a tic-tac-toe web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering an engaging and interactive gaming experience. 
The HTML structures the game board, CSS provides styling for a visually appealing and responsive layout, and JavaScript handles game logic, including user clicks, tracking game state, and checking for winning conditions. 
Players can compete against each other or an AI opponent, with the goal of placing three markers in a row to win. 
This project demonstrates how these technologies work together to create a fun and dynamic tic-tac-toe game.
